## Original User Request:
I want to build a frontend of a webapp using React.js. What I want in the frontend:
- Page 1 (the landing page): Logo and caption that says "Neurooncology unlocked for anyone, everyone" and "Click to start". User clicks anywhere and it goes to page 2. 
- Page 2: Ability for users to add images (any n number of images) with a chatbot feature below (which interacts which the Gemini API). Chatbot unlocks after user uploads images and press a submit button and the backend runs to classify the image etc. 
- Page 3: History of all previous prompts.
